            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <h3>Why is Miyazaki my favorite movie director?</h3>
            <p>
              Many artists possess creative faculties that seem superhuman.
              Among them are those able to harness their creative force of will
              and impress it on the world through their medium of choice,
              becoming iconic in their form of expression. I talk of people like
              Hayao Miyazaki, the legendary animator whose style and direction
              are high examples of what is possible in art.

                <h4>Howl's Moving Castle</h4>
                <p>
                  Sophie, an average teenage girl working in a hat shop, finds
                  her life thrown into turmoil when she is literally swept off
                  her feet by a handsome but mysterious wizard named Howl. After
                  this chance meeting she is turned into a 90-year old woman by
                  the vain and conniving Witch of the Waste.

                <p>
                  Howl's Moving Castle shows us a relatable version of our
                  reality, while allowing us to dream of a world where the
                  selflessness of people encourages them to do the right thing.
                  A world where people in power listen to reason, and even the
                  worst villains can change for the better when shown
                  compassion.

                <h4>Spirited Away</h4>
                <p>
                  Spirited Away is a wondrous fantasy about a young girl named
                  Chihiro who discovers a secret world of strange spirits,
                  creatures and sorcery. When her parents are mysteriously
                  transformed, she must call upon the courage to free herself
                  and return her family to the outside world.

                <h5>What I like about?</h5>
                <p>
                  This is a thrilling, spectacularly beautiful movie, though
                  it's not for little kids who get scared. Despite the animation
                  similarities, Spirited Away is not Totoro, the beloved
                  "feel-good" classic, but an edgy portrayal of what a young
                  girl needs to do to grow up and take responsibility not only
                  for herself, but for her family too.

                <h4>Princess Mononoke</h4>
                <p>
                  Inflicted with a deadly curse, the young warrior Ashitaka
                  heads west in search of a cure. There, he stumbles into a
                  bitter conflict between Lady Eboshi, and the enigmatic
                  Princess Mononoke, who will stop at nothing to prevent the
                  humans from destroying her home and the forest spirits.

                <h5>Release</h5>
                <p>July 12, 1997</p>
                <h5>What I like about?</h5>
                <p>
                  'Princess Mononoke' gives empowered voices to women (in a time
                  where they didn't have any) & doesn't make them victims in
                  need of a savior. It also forces audiences to look inward and
                  question the way we consume things from the world around us.
                  The film is also an opportunity to discuss the early history
                  of Japan.
