            <h2>Why Hayao Miyazaki?</h2>
            <h3>Miyazaki, living life fearless</h3>
            <p>
              Many artists possess creative faculties that seem superhuman.
              Among them are those able to harness their creative force of will
              and impress it on the world through their medium of choice,
              becoming iconic in their form of expression. I talk of people like
              Hayao Miyazaki, the legendary animator whose style and direction
              are high examples of what is possible in art.
            </p>
            <p>
              His movies embrace the fantastical but also transmute it, adding
              his own tincture of quirkiness and absurdism by bending concepts
              in a way that Lewis Carrol might have envied. The worlds of
              Miyazaki are many: there’re chaotic, post-apocalyptic realities
              ravaged by giant mutant insects; they’re tribal-feudal lands where
              warriors fight mythical beasts and ‘proto-industrialists’ armed
              with early medieval weapons; and they’re fantasies involving
              children encountering hidden worlds and forest spirits.

            <p>
              Hi! My name is Yana and I've been watching Miyazaki's animation
              movies for several months. I'm very interested on his stories. I
              created this page as part of a project for SheCodes Responsive to
              develop my coding skills.
